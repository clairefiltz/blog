# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme.

## What to Expect

On this blog, I plan to share:

- My thoughts on technology
- Projects I'm working on
- Tutorials and guides
- Anything else that interests me

## Code Example

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in Python:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_hello()
```
